# AMBANI-AR-REP

## Introduction
AMBANI-AR-REP is a web-based augmented reality replica of Ambani Africa's AR app. Ambani Africa is a tech startup dedicated to using technology to teach languages through interactive AR books.

## Project Reason
The decision to build a web-based replica of their mobile application is driven by the broader accessibility of Web AR compared to Mobile/Native AR. With the web application, any mobile phone with a browser and a camera can run the AR experience, eliminating the need for specialized features that some devices lack. This ensures compatibility and allows a wider range of users to enjoy the same experience without the requirement of downloading a large application.

## Developer
- Sthembizo Molefi

## Tools
-HTML,CSS,W3.CSS
-AR.js , A-FRAME


## Notes
Please note that not all books have AR models available at the moment. Efforts are ongoing to acquire suitable models for those books. In the meantime, do check out the Animal book as it features some correct models.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download ngrok and a live server.
2. Start the live server.
3. Run ngrok.
4. Share the generated link with your mobile device to experience the AR application.
